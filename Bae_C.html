<p class="one"> You break up with them, storming out. Nothing they do can make up for it. You&#39;re a strong, independent young woman. Now what?! You feel awful; your date doesn&#39;t know why you stormed out on them. Maybe the relationship should have ended, maybe not. A key part of being in a relationship is being able to work through conflicts together. There&#39;s nothing wrong with defending yourself, however, you may want to reconsider being so impulsive.

<p class="one"> You agree, and put on makeup to please them. But you also realize that they don&#39;t like you for who you are. When you go home, you cry and your mascara runs. Your date probably didn&#39;t see a problem with what they said. However, at the end of the day, your confidence is hit hard by what they said; you&#39;re upset and your date will never know. What you should have done was explain what was wrong with what they said. Your relationship would be better for it.
You agree</p>
